            <h2 class="subtitle">How Internet Computer Stands Out?</h2><br>
            <p> Today's decentralized app(dApp) are only partially decentralized, and have very small amount of data and services hosted on secure blockchain due to the limited capability of hosting huge data on existing blockchain, like Etherium. 
                Instead, they use legacy web2 technology such as Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure in order to host data, or use Chrome extension to connect with wallet.  
                so any of these companies, Amazon, Microsoft, can actually shut down your project anytime they want.                 
                Ethereum was built primarily to act as a ledger. It's not designed to handle a lot of computation or data storage.
                </p>
            <p>And they came up with basically a novel consensus algorithm, what they call threshold relay, and it

                allows the Internet computer to be able to reach much faster
                
                speeds when compared to the other major layer one blockchains that are currently in existence.</p>

                     Motoko is a new programming language for smart contracts. It is designed to seamlessly support the programming model of the Internet Computer and makes it easier to take advantage of the unique features of the blockchain. Motoko is strongly typed, actor-based, and has built-in support for orthogonal persistence and asynchronous message passing. Productivity and safety features include automatic memory management, generics, type inference, pattern matching, and both arbitrary- and fixed-precision arithmetic. Messaging transparently employs the Internet Computer’s Candid interface definition language and wire format for typed, high-level, and cross-language interoperability.

        <h3>WEB3:</h3><p> With the Internet Computer Protocol, developers can build lightning-fast dapps that are truly decentralized from end to end, as well as take advantage of low-cost decentralized storage. Best of all, there are no gas fees for users and low gas fees for developers. Web3 empowers the creators, builders, and users of decentralized platforms.</p>
<br>
        <h3>DEFI:</h3><p> The Internet Computer expands the world of possibilities of decentralized finance in a multi-chain world. DeFi on the Internet Computer integrates with dapps and offers a seamless user experience with low fees.
        </p><br>
        <h3>NFT, GAMING & METAVERSE:</h3> <p>Imagine 100% on-chain NFTs in the metaverse, guaranteed to last forever. The Internet Computer’s “reverse-gas model” means no hefty gas fees for users, and affordable minting for developers and creators. Low storage costs are just the cherry on top, enabling fully on-chain gameplay, 4k films, music libraries, and so on as NFTs. The only limit is your imagination.
        </p><br>
        <h3>DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL:</h3><p>Web3 will revolutionize the way people organize, communicate, and collaborate. The Internet Computer is uniquely positioned to enable the world’s transition from Web2 to Web3, as social networks and dapps are completely on-chain, allowing for seamless user experiences and mass adoption. Decentralized Social (DeSo) enables users for the first time to be in control and can make social media work for them.
        </p><br>
        <h3>INFRASTRUCTURE:</h3><p> The Internet Computer is one of the top five fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems, and infrastructure is key to developer adoption. Examples include Canister Development Kits (CDKs), agents, IDEs, debuggers, oracles, asset bridges, and general integrations and APIs.
        </p><br>
        <h3>SOCIAL IMPACT:</h3><p> The Internet Computer is a globally accessible, affordable and scalable blockchain, whose developers and users can be found all around the world. Build projects that positively impact your local community and beyond. Web3 affords us the opportunity to rebuild the systems that we have in place today, in order to create a more fair and transparent future.
